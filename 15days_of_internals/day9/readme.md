4. **TCP Congestion Control**
   - Algorithms to manage network congestion
   - Configurable (e.g., Cubic, BBR)

### Practical Example: Simple TCP Server

Here's a basic TCP server implementation in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

#define PORT 8080

int main() {
    int server_fd, new_socket;
    struct sockaddr_in address;
    int opt = 1;
    int addrlen = sizeof(address);
    char buffer[1024] = {0};
    char *hello = "Hello from server";

    // Creating socket file descriptor
    if ((server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == 0) {
        perror("socket failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080
    if (setsockopt(server_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR | SO_REUSEPORT, &opt, sizeof(opt))) {
        perror("setsockopt");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    address.sin_family = AF_INET;
    address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
    address.sin_port = htons(PORT);

    // Forcefully attaching socket to the port 8080
    if (bind(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, sizeof(address)) < 0) {
        perror("bind failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if (listen(server_fd, 3) < 0) {
        perror("listen");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    if ((new_socket = accept(server_fd, (struct sockaddr *)&address, (socklen_t*)&addrlen)) < 0) {
        perror("accept");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);
    printf("Message from client: %s\n", buffer);
    send(new_socket, hello, strlen(hello), 0);
    printf("Hello message sent\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Gotchas and Best Practices

1. **Buffer Management**: Properly manage buffers to avoid overflows and underflows.
2. **Error Handling**: Always check return values of socket operations.
3. **Non-blocking I/O**: Use non-blocking sockets for high-performance applications.
4. **Keep-Alive**: Implement keep-alive mechanisms for long-lived connections.
5. **Security**: Be aware of potential security issues like buffer overflows and use proper input validation.

### Interview Questions

1. Q: Explain the purpose of the `sk_buff` structure in the Linux networking stack.
   A: The `sk_buff` (socket buffer) is a key data structure that represents network packets at all layers of the TCP/IP stack. It contains the actual packet data along with metadata such as protocol information, timestamps, and routing details. This structure allows efficient manipulation of packets as they move through the networking stack.

2. Q: What is the difference between TCP and UDP at the transport layer?
   A: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. It establishes a connection before data transfer and includes flow control and congestion control mechanisms. UDP (User Datagram Protocol), on the other hand, is a connectionless protocol that provides a simple, unreliable datagram service. UDP is faster and has less overhead but does not guarantee delivery or ordering of packets.

3. Q: How does the Netfilter framework contribute to Linux networking?
   A: Netfilter is a framework in the Linux kernel that allows packet filtering and manipulation. It provides hooks at various points in the networking stack where custom code can be inserted to examine and modify network traffic. Netfilter is the foundation for tools like iptables, which are used for firewalling, Network Address Translation (NAT), and packet mangling.

4. Q: Explain the concept of network namespaces in Linux.
   A: Network namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that provide isolation of the network stack. Each namespace has its own network interfaces, routing tables, firewall rules, and network configuration. This allows for the creation of multiple isolated network environments on a single system, which is particularly useful for containerization and network virtualization.

5. Q: What is TCP congestion control, and why is it important?
   A: TCP congestion control is a mechanism used to manage network congestion by adjusting the rate at which data is sent. It's important because it helps prevent network collapse due to congestion, ensures fair sharing of network resources, and optimizes overall network performance. Linux supports various congestion control algorithms (e.g., Cubic, BBR) that can be selected based on network characteristics and requirements.

## 2. Network Configuration and Troubleshooting

### Introduction
Effective network configuration and troubleshooting are essential skills for any Linux system administrator or developer working with networked applications.

### Network Configuration

1. **Network Interfaces**
   - Configuring with `ifconfig` (legacy) or `ip` command
   - Persistent configuration in `/etc/network/interfaces` or NetworkManager

2. **Routing**
   - Viewing and modifying routing table with `route` or `ip route`
   - Configuring static routes

3. **DNS Configuration**
   - `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS resolver configuration
   - `/etc/hosts` for static hostname to IP mappings

4. **Firewall Configuration**
   - `iptables` for packet filtering and NAT
   - `ufw` or `firewalld` for higher-level firewall management

### Network Troubleshooting Tools

1. **ping**
   - Tests basic connectivity to a host

2. **traceroute/tracepath**
   - Shows the path packets take to a destination

3. **netstat/ss**
   - Displays network connections and their states

4. **tcpdump**
   - Captures and analyzes network traffic

5. **nmap**
   - Network exploration and security auditing

6. **wireshark**
   - Detailed packet analysis with GUI

### Practical Example: Network Troubleshooting Script

Here's a bash script that performs basic network diagnostics:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Network Interface Information:"
ip addr show

echo -e "\nDefault Gateway:"
ip route | grep default

echo -e "\nDNS Servers:"
cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver

echo -e "\nTesting connectivity to google.com:"
ping -c 4 google.com

echo -e "\nTraceroute to google.com:"
traceroute google.com

echo -e "\nOpen network connections:"
ss -tuln

echo -e "\nARP cache:"
arp -e
```

### Advanced Networking Concepts

1. **Network Bonding**
   - Combining multiple network interfaces for redundancy or increased throughput

2. **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**
   - Segmenting networks at the data link layer

3. **Network Bridges**
   - Connecting multiple network segments at the data link layer

4. **Network Tunneling**
   - Encapsulating network protocols within other protocols (e.g., VPNs)

5. **Quality of Service (QoS)**
   - Managing network traffic to reduce latency and packet loss

### Gotchas and Best Practices

1. **Documentation**: Keep network configurations well-documented.
2. **Backup**: Always backup network configuration files before making changes.
3. **Security**: Regularly update and patch network-related software.
4. **Monitoring**: Implement network monitoring to proactively identify issues.
5. **Testing**: Test network changes in a non-production environment first.

### Interview Questions

1. Q: What is the difference between `ifconfig` and `ip` commands?
   A: `ifconfig` is a legacy command for configuring network interfaces, while `ip` is a more modern and versatile tool. `ip` provides more functionality, including the ability to manage routing tables, network namespaces, and VPN tunnels. `ip` is part of the iproute2 package and is considered the preferred tool for network configuration in modern Linux systems.

2. Q: Explain the purpose of the `/etc/hosts` file.
   A: The `/etc/hosts` file is used for local DNS resolution. It maps hostnames to IP addresses, allowing the system to resolve these names without querying a DNS server. This file is useful for:
      - Setting up local development environments
      - Blocking access to specific websites by redirecting their hostnames
      - Providing a fallback when DNS servers are unavailable
      - Overriding DNS for specific hostnames

3. Q: How would you troubleshoot a situation where a server can't connect to the internet?
   A: Steps to troubleshoot:
      1. Check physical network connections
      2. Verify IP configuration (`ip addr show`)
      3. Check default gateway (`ip route`)
      4. Test DNS resolution (`nslookup` or `dig`)
      5. Ping the default gateway and a public IP (e.g., 8.8.8.8)
      6. Check firewall rules (`iptables -L`)
      7. Examine system logs (`/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl`)
      8. Use `traceroute` to identify where the connection fails
      9. Check for any proxy settings
      10. Verify network interface status and errors (`ethtool` or `ip -s link`)

4. Q: What is network bonding, and when would you use it?
   A: Network bonding is a method of combining multiple network interfaces into a single logical interface. It's used for:
      - Increased throughput by load-balancing traffic across multiple links
      - Redundancy and fault tolerance (if one link fails, others can take over)
      - Aggregating bandwidth from multiple lower-speed links
   Common use cases include server environments where high availability and performance are critical, or in scenarios where a single network interface doesn't provide sufficient bandwidth.

5. Q: Explain the concept of VLANs and how they are implemented in Linux.
   A: VLANs (Virtual LANs) are a method of creating logically separate networks within a physical network infrastructure. In Linux, VLANs are implemented using:
      - Kernel VLAN support
      - VLAN interfaces (e.g., eth0.100 for VLAN 100 on eth0)
      - Configuration tools like `vconfig` or `ip link add` command
   VLANs allow for:
      - Network segmentation without physical separation
      - Improved security by isolating traffic
      - Better management of broadcast domains
      - Flexibility in network design and resource allocation
   To create a VLAN interface in Linux, you might use a command like:
   ```
   ip link add link eth0 name eth0.100 type vlan id 100
   ```
   This creates a VLAN interface for VLAN 100 on the eth0 physical interface.

## Prerequisites
- Solid understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with basic Linux system calls and POSIX standards
- Experience with Linux kernel compilation and configuration

## Setup Requirements
- Linux development environment (preferably Debian or Fedora-based)
- GCC compiler suite
- Linux kernel source code
- Root access for kernel module loading and system configuration

## Recommended Reading
